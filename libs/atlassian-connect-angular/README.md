# Atlassian Connect Angular

This package contains the Angular code needed to integrate your Angular application with Atlassian Connect's APIs and global JS system. This package is typically automatically added & used in tangent with the [`@oasisdigital/atlassian-connect-nx-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oasisdigital/atlassian-connect-nx-plugin) npm package.

## Standalone usage

If you are not using this package in tangent with the above nx plugin, you will want to have added the following script your Angular application's `index.html` before making use of the code from this package:

`<script src="https://connect-cdn.atl-paas.net/all.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>`
